# Tic-React-Toe

This is a simple learning project to dip my toes into React. The app is a functional Tic-Tac-Toe game with the ability to move back in time through the game history.

## Build Process

I built the app in small, component scale, pieces(Square, Board, Game) before refactoring into a more efficient model where state is stored only in the Game class and passed down through to the board and square.

The build process allowed me to practice and experiment with state, react components, and mutability vs immutability.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
